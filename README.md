  Learn to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions

  # üïµÔ∏è Browser Extension Security Check Report

##  Objective
Learn to identify and remove potentially harmful browser extensions that may pose security or privacy risks.

## Tools Used
- **Google Chrome** 
- **Mozilla Firefox** 
- **Search Engine** for extension reputation checks (e.g., Google, Reddit, official reviews)



## 1. Check Browser Extensions:

Extensions can:
- Access **all browsing data**, including passwords and history.
- Inject ads, track activity, or steal sensitive information.
- Become malicious after updates or if sold to third parties.



## 2. How I Checked for Suspicious Extensions

1. Opened the extensions page:
   - **Chrome:** `chrome://extensions/`
   - **Firefox:** `about:addons`
2. Reviewed each installed extension for:
   - **Unfamiliar or unused names**
   - **Excessive permissions** (e.g., ‚ÄúRead and change all data on websites‚Äù)
   - **Poor ratings or no official source**
3. Searched each extension online for reviews and security alerts.
4. Removed or disabled suspicious extensions.



## 3. Extensions Found

| Extension Name       | Status  | Reason for Action                         |
|----------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| **AdBlock Plus**     | Kept    | Legitimate, verified source              |
| **Grammarly**        | Kept    | Popular, trusted extension               |
| **Free VPN Unlimited**| Removed | Unverified developer, excessive permissions |
| **Coupon Finder**    | Removed | Displays ads, collects browsing data     |



## 4. Observations

- Free VPN and coupon-related extensions often request **broad permissions** that can compromise security.
- Some extensions remain safe initially but can turn malicious after updates.
- Always install from the **official browser web store** and check reviews.



## 5. Best Practices

- **Audit extensions regularly** ‚Äî remove what you don‚Äôt use.
- **Install only from trusted sources** (Chrome Web Store, Mozilla Add-ons).
- Avoid installing extensions that:
  - Request access to all websites.


##  Conclusion

Unnecessary or untrusted extensions can pose serious security risks. Regular checks and removing unused or suspicious add-ons improve privacy and reduce the chance of malware infections.
